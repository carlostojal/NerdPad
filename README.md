You can find the files in <i>/bin/GCC</i><br><br>
<b>To do that (Windows):</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Open <b>CMD</b></li>
  <li>Type <i>set path</i></li>
  <li>If path to GCC compiler appears there, all is ok</li>
  <li>Else, open the Control Panel and go to <i>System and Security->System->Advanced System Settings->Environment variables->System variables->Path</i> and add the path to the GCC binaries
