<ul>
  <li>Open CMD</li>
  <li>Type "set path"</li>
  <li>If path to GCC compiler appears there, all is ok</li>
  <li>Else, open the control panel and go to <i>System and Security->System->Advanced System Settings->Environment variables->System variables->Path</i> and add the path to the GCC binaries
